- Prometheus : Fixed Read/WriteConfXXX, pci_physic_to_logic_addr, pci_set_master & 
    pci_obtain_card/pci_release_card requires prometheus.library v3 (Titan)
- Pegasos1/2 & Grex : Fixed Address base value for ROM, pci_obtain_card/pci_release_card bug/crash (Titan)
- Mediator : Fixed pci_obtain_card/pci_release_card (Titan)
- Amithlon : Fixed pci_obtain_card/pci_release_card (Titan)

News in V2.0

- New functions : pci_physic_to_logic_addr()/pci_obtain_card()/pci_release_card()
- This version is fully compatible with old drivers developped for openpci v1.x but i advise you
to support new pci card lock mechanism (pci_obtain_card()/pci_release_card()) to avoid problems 
with drivers who use the same pci card.
- Fixed read & write_config for Prometheus
- Use lock mechanism of Prometheus, Amithlon, Grex
Warning this library support Mediator and i haven't tested it on 
Mediator, Prometheus, Grex, Amithlon but it could work.
Please test and send me feedback for Mediator, Prometheus, Grex, Amithlon, Pegasos1 & Pegasos2.

Informations:

The openpci.library currently support fully MediatorA1200/Z4, Pegasos1/2, GrexA1200, GrexA4000, Amithlon and Prometheus.
Prometheus wrapper is finished but need more testing.

openpci.library.elf :
- This is for MorphOS and Pegasos, it's a PPC MorphOS native version.
- This native PPC MorphOS native version support Pegasos1/2, GrexA1200, GrexA4000, Prometheus PCI Bus.

For Pegasos1/2 use openpci.library.elf ONLY and remove openpci.library if it exist,
because openpci.library doesn't support Pegasos1/2.

openpci.library:
- This is a 68k version for AmigaOS 3.x and Amithlon
- This version support Mediator A1200, GrexA1200, GrexA4000, Prometheus, PC PCI Bus under Amithlon.

Details of Mediator GFX card DMA memory supported in OpenPCI:
1) Voodoo Banshee 16MB VendorID/ProductID=0x121a/0x0003
2) Voodoo3/2000-3000 16MB VendorID/ProductID=0x121a/0x0005

Note: Total available DMA memory is configured to 256KB.
Warning!!! If you have not one of this GFX card, the DMA memory is disabled and all drivers which requires DMA memory will not work (driver like RTL8139, USB ... will not work).

Not supported Mediator due to lack on information on these boards (contact me):
I need more expansion information(showconfig) on following Product MediatorXXX/MEMORY.
1) Mediator Unknown1 => Expansion Products: Mediator???0x30)+Mediator??? MEMORY(0xb0)
2) Mediator Unknown2 => Expansion Products: Mediator???(0x31)+Mediator??? MEMORY(0xb1)
Any other number ... contact me.
